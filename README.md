# PyD

PyD provides seamless interoperability between Python and the D programming language.

# Usage

To use with dub, either specify the relevant subConfiguration for your python version,
or run `source pyd_set_env_vars.sh <your python>` on linux or
`pyd_set_env_vars.bat <your python>` on windows to set the relevant environment variables
and use the `env` subConfiguration.

These scripts can be run from any directory, but to facilitate using PyD as a dependency
pulled from the dub registry you can run `dub run pyd:setup` to copy them to the current
directory for use, e.g. given you are in the current directory of a package that depends
on pyd, run `dub run pyd:setup` followed by `source pyd_set_env_vars.sh`, then build
your package as normal.

# Requirements

## Python

CPython 2.6+

## D Compilers

* DMD, LDC fe2.065+
* GDC fe2.065+, embedding only (GDC still doesn't have shared library support!)

Note all D compilers are based on DMD's front end, so while LDC and GDC have
their own verisoning schemes, I only pay attention to the front end version.
